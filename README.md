# hero-txt
It's important to remember that the headline and the subheadline in the hero section are there to help users understand what you do and what service you provide. They can also influence whether someone has a good or bad first impression of your business. As a website owner, it's essential to be mindful of the content you're using in this area. Here's **a library of copywriting ideas for the hero section of websites.**  

Based on my past experience, most of the samples I've collected are from the IT industry. If you have samples from other industries, **please feel free to submit your idea by opening an issue.**
